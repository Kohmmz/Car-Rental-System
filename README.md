Managing Database Migrations

If you've made any changes to your SQLAlchemy models (Car, Customer, Rental), you need to generate a new migration:

alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe your change here"

Example:

alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Added new field to Car model"

This command will scan your lib/model.py file and create a new migration file inside the migrations/versions/ folder.

Apply the New Migration to Your Database

After generating the migration, apply it using:

alembic upgrade head

This updates your SQLite database schema to match the latest version of your SQLAlchemy models.

Checking Applied Migrations

To see all migrations that have been applied, use:

alembic history

To check the current version of the database, run:

alembic current

Undoing a Migration

If the migration breaks something and you need to go one step back, use:

alembic downgrade -1

If you need to go back multiple steps, replace -1 with the number of steps (e.g., -2, -3, etc.).

Usage

Follow the on-screen prompts in the CLI to navigate and perform operations.

Ensure that the database is properly migrated before usage.

Future Enhancements

Implement a GUI version of the application.

Add authentication and user roles.

Integrate with an external API for real-time pricing and availability.
